Lots of problems!

* Lacks xmlHttpRequest support,
  but GM_xmlhttprequest() should be available.

* Style is less than awesome.

* Clusty icon missing, since clusty was renamed.

* Closing the Ubiquity window with ESC sometimes
  can cause Chrome to crash.

* Many other problems to fix I suppose...
