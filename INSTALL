HOW TO INSTALL THIS EXTENSION
=============================

1) Install the "Dev Channel" version of Google Chrome.
   Everyone tells you to.
   NOT SURE THIS IS NECESSARY ANYMORE.

2) Launch Chrome with the "--enable-user-scripts" flag.
   NOT SURE THIS IS NECESSARY ANYMORE.

3) Copy/Download the ubiquity-chrome.user.js file to your
   local hard drive.

4) Drag and drop the ubiquity-chrome.user.js file into your
   Chrome window.

In particular, forget all the stuff about copying the
file in some AppData\DefaultCrap folder. It's useless.
Half of the internet is just plain outdated :)
